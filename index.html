 Augusta Ada King-Noel, Countess of Lovelace (née Byron; 10 December 1815 – 27 November 1852) was an English mathematician and writer, </br>chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's early mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. Her notes on the engine <br/>include what is recognised as the first algorithm intended to be carried out by a machine. As a result, she is often regarded as the first computer programmer.
 </p><br/><br/><br/> <hr/>  <p>
 Ada Lovelace was the only legitimate child of the poet George, Lord Byron and his wife Anne Isabella Milbanke ("Annabella"), Lady Wentworth. <br/>
 All Byron's other children were born out of wedlock to other women. Byron separated from his wife a month after Ada was born and left England <br/>forever four months later, eventually dying of disease in the Greek War of Independence when Ada was eight years old. Her mother remained <br/> bitter towards Lord Byron and promoted Ada's interest in mathematics and logic in an effort to prevent her from developing what she saw as the <br/>insanity seen in her father, but Ada remained interested in him despite this (and was, upon her eventual death, buried next to him at her request).<br/>Often ill, she spent most of her childhood sick. Ada married William King in 1835. King was made Earl of Lovelace in 1838, and she became Countess of Lovelace.
